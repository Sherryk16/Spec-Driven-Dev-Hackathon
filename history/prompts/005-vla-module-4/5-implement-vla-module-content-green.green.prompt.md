## Prompt

Execute the implementation plan by processing and executing all tasks defined in tasks.md

## Response snapshot

I have executed the implementation plan. I created the directory structure, the placeholder files, updated the sidebar, and then populated the chapter files with content. I also expanded the content to better meet the word count requirements.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created the content for the VLA module.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 4 files modified.
- 🔁 Next prompts: 
- 🧠 Reflection: The initial check for completion in tasks.md was misleading. I correctly identified that the tasks were not actually completed and proceeded with the implementation. The word count check failed, and I took corrective action to expand the content. The PHR script was missing, so I had to fall back to the manual method.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Incorrect task completion status, missing script.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): 
- Prompt variant (if applicable): 
- Next experiment:
