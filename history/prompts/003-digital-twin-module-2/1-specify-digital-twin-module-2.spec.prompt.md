## Response snapshot

I have successfully created the feature specification for "Book Module 2: The Digital Twin — Gazebo & Unity".

- **Branch Created**: `003-digital-twin-module-2`
- **Specification File**: `specs/003-digital-twin-module-2/spec.md`
- **Validation**: The specification has passed all quality checks in `specs/003-digital-twin-module-2/checklists/requirements.md`.

The feature is now ready for the planning phase.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a new feature specification for the second book module, establishing a clear definition of the content and goals.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: `specs/003-digital-twin-module-2/spec.md` and `specs/003-digital-twin-module-2/checklists/requirements.md` were created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.plan`
- 🧠 Reflection: The manual process for creating the feature branch and directories continues to be a reliable workaround for the script failure on Windows. This process is now well-established.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: N/A (Manual process was used).
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
