## Response snapshot

I have successfully created the feature specification for "Book Module 3: AI-Robot Brain — NVIDIA Isaac".

- **Branch Created**: `004-isaac-brain-module-3`
- **Specification File**: `specs/004-isaac-brain-module-3/spec.md`
- **Validation**: The specification has passed all quality checks in `specs/004-isaac-brain-module-3/checklists/requirements.md`.

The feature is now ready for the planning phase.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a new feature specification for the third book module.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: `specs/004-isaac-brain-module-3/spec.md` and `specs/004-isaac-brain-module-3/checklists/requirements.md` were created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.plan`
- 🧠 Reflection: The manual feature creation process is now routine and efficient.
