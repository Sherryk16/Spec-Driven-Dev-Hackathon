# Specification Quality Checklist: Book Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-10
**Feature**: [./specs/001-ros2-module-1/spec.md](./specs/001-ros2-module-1/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [ ] Edge cases are identified (N/A for conceptual book module)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified (implicitly through focus and target audience)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`
