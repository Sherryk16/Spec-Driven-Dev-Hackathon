## Prompt

/sp.tasks

## Response snapshot

I have generated the `tasks.md` file, which contains a detailed, dependency-ordered breakdown of the authoring work required for "Book Module 3: AI-Robot Brain — NVIDIA Isaac".

- **Path**: `specs/004-isaac-brain-module-3/tasks.md`
- **Total Tasks**: 26
- **MVP Scope**: The Minimum Viable Product consists of completing Phase 1 (Setup) and Phase 2 (writing Chapter 1).
- **Parallel Opportunities**: The writing for all three chapters can occur in parallel after the initial setup is complete.

The project is now ready for implementation (content authoring).

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a clear and actionable task list for authoring a new content module.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were generated as this is a content-creation feature.
- 📁 Files: `specs/004-isaac-brain-module-3/tasks.md` was created successfully.
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.implement`
- 🧠 Reflection: The task generation process for a content module continues to be effective in breaking down the writing process.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
